\b Brexit-Ninja \
\
Premise\
\

\b0 \ulnone - heads of leading Brexit campaigners generate at the bottom of a grid, and travel up towards the top.\
- you have to hover your mouse over them to stop them, which will animate a \'91fact book\'92 to hit them with.\
- the heads will then pop with a sound effect\
- if you let 3 heads get to the top, Brexit happens and you lose\
- each head will have a different speed and generate randomly across a particular section of the game board \
- for example, farage will travel faster than Boris Johnson \
- there will be levels which increase the number of heads to pop, max level of 10.\
- you win after 30 seconds \
\

\b \ul Logic for MVP\

\b0 \ulnone - create a game board of 36 lis \
- give the first six lis a class of finish for the balloons\
- give the last three rows a class of start for the balloons\
- give the ul a class of game board\
- use css to create the game board \
- make a class for three types of balloon, slow, medium and fast\
- the classes are different colours, red, yellow and green\
- set a variable for missed balloons\
- use animate method to set up the behaviour of the balloons - as in, where they generate, how fast they go \
- the behaviour of those classes will be defined within the method animate \
- green to go randomly and slowly \
- yellow to go medium\
- red to go fast \
- enable a mouseover event listener so when the mouse is over the ballon it pops it\
- use a for loop to go through the generate balloon function to checking how many missed balloons there are\
\
- make sure that the callback in the animation adds one to missed balloons only if completed\
- and that the event listener prevents the animation from completing, making the loop in generate balloons fire again, restarting the cycle \
- make an if statement to say if the number of balloons reaches three to return a you lose alert \
- add a reset button in the alert to reload the page and reset the game \
- start levels, which will increase the number of balloons appearing with more quicker ones\
\

\b \ul V2:
\b0 \ulnone \
- make a balloon to appear at 100 points that if you hit it, you fail\
- when refactoring, move the event listeners to the top of the innit, with the start screen\
- change the reset button\'92s function to calling the reset button itself \
- start introducing the this\'92s}
